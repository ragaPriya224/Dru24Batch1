Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of Student class.

Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number

It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.

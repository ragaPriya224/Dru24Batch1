1. create 2  sb projects with necessary dependency 
2. in each sb project, get api  - controller, repo  files were created
3. use resttemplate - check getapi working properly or not.. both getapi are checked
4. now stop catalogservice, hit userapi -> 500 error. 
how to handle this?
now, we need to give some responses to the user to engage the user
5. ad dependency - actuator, aop, resilience4j
6. change app.properties
7. in  user controller -> circuit breaker @, fallback method
8. 

started both the servers, hit http://localhost:9192/user-service/displayOrders - original data is coming
http://localhost:9192/actuator/health -> status was up, closed, no failure calls. 
stopped the catalog service, 
   we hit  http://localhost:9192/user-service/displayOrders  - fallback data
   http://localhost:9192/actuator/health -> status was closed, failed calls 1
   hit the http://localhost:9192/user-service/displayOrder  4 more times, check fallback data
   http://localhost:9192/actuator/health -> status was open, 
   refresh -( wait-duration-in-open-state: 5s ) -> status was half open
   http://localhost:9192/user-service/displayOrders hit 3 times, check status of actuator  as open

1. create 2  sb projects with necessary dependency 
2. in each sb project, get api  - controller, repo  files were created
3. use resttemplate - check getapi working properly or not.. both getapi are checked
4. now stop catalogservice, hit userapi -> 500 error. 
how to handle this?
now, we need to give some responses to the user to engage the user
5. ad dependency - actuator, aop, resilience4j
6. change app.properties
7. in  user controller -> circuit breaker @, fallback method
8. 

started both the servers, hit http://localhost:9192/user-service/displayOrders - original data is coming
http://localhost:9192/actuator/health -> status was up, closed, no failure calls.
